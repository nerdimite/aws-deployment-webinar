# Deploying Tensorflow/Keras Models with AWS Sagemaker
## (CellStrat AI Lab Presentation)

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models.

This repository contains the notebook for
* Loading an elsewhere trained model into Sagemaker
* Converting to a Sagemaker readable format
* Deploying
* Setting up an API
